# Getting Started

1. I highly recommend that you read through `gulpfile.coffee`. It's relatively simple and will help you understand how the assets are being compiled in case you run into any issues.
2. Install dependencies: [NPM](http://npmjs.org), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
3. Clone the repository
4. Run `bundle install`. This will install the version of [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) specified in the Gemfile.
5. Run `npm install`
6. Run `bower install`
7. Run `gulp` in one shell. This will watch your files, auto-compile them, and start a local server.
8. Run `karma` in another shell. This will automatically run your unit tests.
9. Install [LiveReload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en) (optional)
10. Open your browser to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:90000).
11. This site is the default code and the documentation. I suggest checking out the sample code page, but then you just need to remove what you don't want and replace this content with your own. Have fun!
